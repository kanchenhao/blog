title: Kan Chenhao's Blog - First Words

I have always wanted to build an independent blog to record problems I encountered and my solutions. This blog is intended to cover both programming  questions and broader questions â€” often about our society.

My first passion is about computer science, especially programming, because I believe the great proverb: **Write the code, Change the world!**. I always believe that the world we are in the process of weaving will be better by programming.

There are not many words at this moment, to be added in the future.

Just enjoy writing the code while young.
