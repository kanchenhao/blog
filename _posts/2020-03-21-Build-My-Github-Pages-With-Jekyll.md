After Ruby is installed, there will be an option, choose to install MSYS2, if it is not checked, open cmd yourself, enter "ridk install" to install MSYS2, there will be a choice of 123, choose 3 and then press Enter, this process will download many installation packages, be patient, be sure to install it completely. After the installation is complete, you will be asked to select 123 again, then press Enter directly. If the installation still fails, you can proceed as follows.

Modify the **mirrorlist.mingw64** file in the **msys64/etc/pacman.d** folder, comment out the default installation source, and add the following sources:

```
Server = https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/msys2/mingw/x86_64
Server = http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/msys2/mingw/x86_64
Server = http://mirror.bit.edu.cn/msys2/mingw/x86_64
```

Similarly, modify the other two files **mirrorlist.mingw32** and **mirrorlist.msys** in this folder to the corresponding sources.

```
Server = https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/msys2/mingw/i686
Server = http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/msys2/mingw/i686
Server = http://mirror.bit.edu.cn/msys2/mingw/i686
```

```
Server = https://mirrors.tuna.tsinghua.edu.cn/msys2/msys/$arch/
Server = http://mirrors.ustc.edu.cn/msys2/msys/$arch/
Server = http://mirror.bit.edu.cn/msys2/msys/$arch/
```
